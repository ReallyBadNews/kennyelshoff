CSS-in-TS libraries such as Stitches and Vanilla Extract are fantastic options for building type-safe UI components; taking away all the worries of class names and StyleSheet composition.

â€¦but CSS-in-TS (or CSS-in-JS) isn't for everyone.

You may need full control over your StyleSheet output. Your job might require you to use a framework such as Tailwind CSS. You might just prefer writing your own CSS.

Creating variants with the "traditional" CSS approach can become an arduous task; manually matching classes to props and manually adding types.

cva aims to take those pain points away, allowing you to focus on the more fun aspects of UI development.
