DETROIT - Widespread power outages caused by intense winds have prompted DTE
Energy to call in hundreds of out-of-state crews to help restore power to
Southeastern Michigan residents.

All of Metro Detroit faced a high wind warning Saturday, as the windy day
produced gusts over 60 mph at times through the afternoon, causing tens of
thousands of customers to lose power. At some point in the day, more than
160,000 customers had lost power due to the severe weather.

I love keyboard shortcuts, one of my favorites is the <kbd><Kbd>Cmd</Kbd> +
<Kbd>K</Kbd></kbd> menu that has become a popular shortcut for navigating web
apps.

Several neighborhoods faced uprooted trees and toppling power lines amid the
high winds. Select `any word` from the following list.

```jsx line=2,6-8 showLineNumbers
import React from "react";
import { Button } from "../../components/Button";

function MyButton() {
  return (
    <Button size="2" variant="blue">
      Hello world
    </Button>
  );
}
```

## Bye for now

According to DTE, the Metro Detroit area suffered from more than 1,500 downed
wires, broken poles and tree-related damage.

As of 8:20 a.m. Sunday, about 70,000 DTE Energy customers were without power. At
that time, power was restored to about 90,000 customers so far, officials said.
Weâ€™re tracking Sunday power outages right here.

The Detroit-based utility company said Saturday that it would be calling in 500
additional crews to help restore power to affected customers. Officials say
power is expected to be restored to most customers, 80%-90%, by the end of the
day Sunday.

The company says it hopes to have power restored to all schools in time for
class on Monday.
