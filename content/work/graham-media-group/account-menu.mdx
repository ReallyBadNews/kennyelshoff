As [Pedro Duarte](https://ped.ro/) said in his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcMYcjtWwVI) demonstrating the capabilities of [Radix Primitives](https://radix-ui.com/), building an accessible dropdown is much harder than it appears on the surface.

There are countless factors to consider, from keyboard navigation and focus management to aria-roles and screen reader support the [Menu Button WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/#menubutton) lists many design details to implement and test, as well warnings and common mistakes.

For example, the `button` element that triggers the `Dropdown` should include the following interactions while focus is on the button:

- <Kbd>Enter</Kbd>: opens the menu and places focus on the first menu item.
- <Kbd>Space</Kbd>: opens the menu and places focus on the first menu item.
- <Kbd>Down Arrow</Kbd> _(optional)_: opens the menu and moves focus to the first
  menu item.
- <Kbd>Up Arrow</Kbd> _(optional)_: opens the menu and moves focus to the last menu
  item.

## Accessible Primitives

There are a number of open source libraries who's goal it is to make building accessible components easier. These components typically come unstyled, and offer a variety of different ways to compose and style them to fit into your design system.

- [Radix Primitives](https://radix-ui.com/): a set of primitives that are styled by default.
- [Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev/): from the team behind [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a set of primitives that are styled by default. Comes in `React` and `Vue` flavors.
- [Reakit](https://reakit.io/): Accessible, composable, customizable, tiny & fast.
- [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/): A library of React Hooks that provides accessible UI primitives for your design system.

For Graham Media Group's design system we chose to use Headless UI's [Menu (Dropdown)](https://headlessui.dev/react/menu/) for it's simple and composable API. While this package is written and maintained by the Tailwind CSS team, it is not dependant on Tailwind for styling.

We use [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) and a TypeScript variant of [styled-system](https://www.styled-system.com/) for styling, and gaining access to all of our defined style props was as easy as passing transforming a component into a primitive through the `as` prop. The component will merge the prop interfaces of the primitive and the component, and the primitive will be styled with the component's props.

```tsx showLineNumbers filename=src/components/Dropdown.tsx {16, 20}
import { Menu, Transition } from "@headlessui/react";
import { Box } from "../Box";
import { Button } from "../Button";

function Dropdown({
  children,
  buttonText = "Open",
  variant = "$primary",
  size = "rg",
}) {
  return (
    <Menu>
      {({ open }) => {
        return (
          <Box>
            {/* By using the polymorphic `as` prop, we gain access to `size` and `variant` */}
            <Menu.Button as={Button} size={size} variant={variant}>
              {buttonText}
            </Menu.Button>
            <Transition show={open}>
              <Menu.Items as={Box} sx={menuItemStyles} static>
                {children}
              </Menu.Items>
            </Transition>
          </Box>
        );
      }}
    </Menu>
  );
}
```

By composing the primitives from the `@headlessui/react` package within our component library, we are able to distribute variant derived styles to the `Menu.Button`, `Menu.Items` and `Menu.Item` components to allow for easy customization, and to allow for easy composition of in the consuming application.

### In Action

<video
  style={{
    width: "var(--sizes-full)",
    height: "auto",
    borderRadius: "var(--radii-lg)",
  }}
  loop
  muted
  autoPlay
  playsInline
>
  <source src="/videos/account-menu.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

The primary use-case of the dropdown menu is the `<AccountMenu />` component, which lives in the site header and is only accessible to logged in users. This provides a quick way to interact with our third party comment provider, navigate to popular pages and account features such as logging out.
