Good morning Michael,

I recently came across the Senior Web Engineer position posted on our careers page and after going through the details, it struck me that it's a natural next step for me being that I have been with the Graham Media family for the past ten years and the past five years with the digital team. I work hard, and I am dedicated to this company and this position.

Over the years at Graham Digital, I've enjoyed building products and finding creative solutions to our business problems. I have particularly appreciated managing the tech side of our core websites, and leading initiatives like the Pins 10x10 project and Insider+ subscriptions, which have been a great success and have helped us grow our business in new ways.

I am thrilled at the prospect of stepping into a senior role, tackling larger projects, and guiding other team members is really exciting to me. My adventures with Arc, AWS, React, TypeScript, and Python have not only driven successful projects like the Pins 10x10 project and Insider+ subscriptions but also set a high standard for quality and finish. I've also enjoyed working with our team to build out our internal tools and processes, fostering a culture of collaboration, continuous innovation and improvement.

I've been working tremendously hard to be become an expert across multiple domains, and have become the go-to guy to find solutions to difficult tasks. I am really looking forward to the possibility of growing with and contributing to our team from a senior position.

Thank you for considering my application. Looking forward to chatting soon.

Thanks,

Kenny Elshoff
