DETROIT - Widespread power outages caused by intense winds have prompted DTE
Energy to call in hundreds of out-of-state crews to help restore power to
Southeastern Michigan residents.

All of Metro Detroit faced a high wind warning Saturday, as the windy day
produced gusts over 60 mph at times through the afternoon, causing tens of
thousands of customers to lose power. At some point in the day, more than
160,000 customers had lost power due to the severe weather.

And if I wanted to get the team then:

```tsx showLineNumbers {1, 9-16}
const users = await prisma.user.findMany({
  select: {
    id: true,
    email: true,
    firstName: true,
    team: true, // <-- just add the field I want
    stringValue: "this is a string",
  },
  where: {
    team: {
      id: {
        equals: "this is a string",
      },
    },
  },
});
```

```jsx
import create from "zustand";

const useStore = create((set) => ({
  bears: 0,
  increasePopulation: () => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + 1 })),
  removeAllBears: () => set({ bears: 0 }),
}));
```

```tsx
// Block without line numbers
const users: Array<{
  id: string;
  email: string;
  firstName: string;
  team: Team;
}>;
```

```css showLineNumbers filename=app/styles/shared.css
/* scope with class names */
.PrimaryButton {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
}

.TileGrid {
  /* ... */
}

/* or scope with data attributes to avoid concatenating
   className props, but it's really up to you */
[data-primary-button] {
  /* ... */
}

[data-tile-grid] {
  /* ... */
}
```

I love keyboard shortcuts, one of my favorites is the <kbd><Kbd>Cmd</Kbd> + <Kbd>K</Kbd></kbd>
menu that has become a popular shortcut for navigating web apps.

```tsx filename="app/route/posts/index.tsx" showLineNumbers
import { Link, useLoaderData } from "remix";

import { getPosts } from "~/post";
import type { Post } from "~/post";

export const loader = async () => {
  return getPosts();
};

// ...
```

Several neighborhoods faced uprooted trees and toppling power lines amid the
high winds. Select `any word` from the following list.

```tsx filename="app/routes/posts/index.tsx" showLineNumbers
import React from "react";
type LoaderData = Await<ReturnType<typeof getLoaderData>>;

async function getLoaderData() {
  const users = await prismaRead.user.findMany({
    select: {
      id: true,
      email: true,
      firstName: true,
      team: true,
      postReads: {
        select: {
          postSlug: true,
        },
      },
    },
  });
  return { users };
}

// export const loader: LoaderFunction = async ({ request }) => {
//   return json(await getLoaderData());
// };

export default function UsersPage() {
  const data = useLoaderData<LoaderData>();
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Users</h1>
      <ul>
        {/* all this auto-completes and type checks!! */}
        {data.users.map((user) => (
          <li key={user.id}>
            <div>{user.firstName}</div>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Bye for now

According to DTE, the Metro Detroit area suffered from more than 1,500 downed
wires, broken poles and tree-related damage.

As of 8:20 a.m. Sunday, about 70,000 DTE Energy customers were without power. At
that time, power was restored to about 90,000 customers so far, officials said.
Weâ€™re tracking Sunday power outages right here.

Clicking "reset" above will reset our component to a different state from its
initial state which is probably a mistake, so we want that to not be possible.
Click it multiple times and it's getting reset to something completely different
every time. Now, I definitely agree with you. This is an example of someone
using the API wrong. But if it's not a lot of work we may as well make this
impossible right?

So, how can we grab hold of the actual initial value and ignore any changes to
that prop? I've got a hint for you. It's not so complicated as `useEffect` with
an `isMounted` boolean or whatever. It's actually pretty simple. And there are a
few ways we could do it:

```tsx
const { current: initialState } = React.useRef({ count: initialCount });
const [initialState] = React.useState({ count: initialCount });
const [initialState] = React.useReducer((s) => s, { count: initialCount });

// actual initial count is: initialState.count
```

The Detroit-based utility company said Saturday that it would be calling in 500
additional crews to help restore power to affected customers. Officials say
power is expected to be restored to most customers, 80%-90%, by the end of the
day Sunday.

The company says it hopes to have power restored to all schools in time for
class on Monday.
